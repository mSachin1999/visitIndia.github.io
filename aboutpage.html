	<p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services & mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store & Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code & managed code. Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense ( the code completion component ) as well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger & a machine-level debugger. Other built-n tools include a code profiler, forms designer for building GUI application web designer, class designer & database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins that enhance the functionality at most every levelâ€”including adding support for source control systems ( like subversion & Git) & adding new toolsets like editors & visual designer for domain=specific languages r toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle (like the Team Foundation server client: Team Explorer). Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages & allows the code editor & debugger to support ( to varying degrees )nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exits. Built-in languages include C,C++,C++/CLI, Visual Basic languages such as Python, Ruby, Node</p>
